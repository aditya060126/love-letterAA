But since I can't be there, I’m sending you my heart in words. Open this when you're ready... ❤️</div>

        <p>My Love, My Everything, Anjali,</p>
        <p>From the moment our paths crossed, my heart knew you were someone special. I can still remember the day I first saw you in school—there was an instant connection, something deeper than words could ever express. You became the first girl I ever texted, and from that very moment, you changed my life in ways I never imagined.</p>
        <p>Back then, when you were at your lowest, broken and weighed down by sadness, all I wanted was to be there for you, to bring even the slightest smile to your face. We talked, we laughed, and in those moments, I found a happiness I never knew existed. With every passing day, my feelings for you grew stronger, and though I expressed them four times, I knew deep down that I would wait for you, no matter how long it took. Because you, Anjali, are worth everything.</p>
        <p>Then came <b>November 26, 2024</b>, a day I will cherish forever. The day you told me that you had started feeling the same way, though you needed more time. That day, my heart felt a joy so pure, so overwhelming, that I knew—this was it. You were the one I had been waiting for. And even now, after everything, I am more certain than ever that you are the most beautiful chapter of my life.</p>
        <p>Every moment with you feels magical, like we’ve known each other forever. I never have to pretend, never have to hide, because with you, I am completely myself. Your voice, your smile, even the smallest things about you make my world brighter. I want to be the reason behind your happiness, just as you are for mine. I want to hold your hand, to walk through every storm and every sunshine together.</p>
        <p>So today, on this Propose Day, I want to say this to you from the depths of my heart:</p>
        <p><b>I don’t just love you, Anjali—I belong to you.</b></p>
        <p>I want to stand beside you in every moment, cherish you in every way, and love you endlessly. Not just for today, not just for tomorrow, but <b>forever</b>.</p>
        <p>Will you be mine, now and always? ❤️</p>
        <p>Yours, Forever and Always,<br>Adi</p>
